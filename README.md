# Key/Value Editor for Umbraco

This property editor is heavily based on the **Multiple Textstrings** built-in
property editor, so should look and behave very similar to that one, even though
it has two textboxes. (So hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd>/<kbd>Return</kbd> adds another
set, and you can sort them by using the handles on the right.)

It should work in Umbraco 7 as well as in Umbraco 8.

## Using the editor

When creating a new DataType, choose `Key/Value Editor` as the property
editor.

As with **Multiple Textstrings** you can specify a minimum number of key/value 
sets, as well as a maximum.
