Key/Value Editor for Umbraco
============================

A property editor that can be used for adding multiple sets of keys and values
to a document, e.g. if you have an Employee doctype and you want the employees
to be able to add some personal facts like shoesize, favorite album etc., but
you don't want to dictate which fields exactly.
